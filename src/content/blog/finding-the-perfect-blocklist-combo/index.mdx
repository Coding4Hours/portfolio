# Finding the Perfect Blocklist Combo

So, when I switched to Zen Browser a few weeks back. I knew that it had no built in adblocker. So, since I had pywalfox, vimium, proton pass, unhook, and ublock origin,
I had a lot of extensions. Duh. So anyway, this is me trying to make NextDNS block replace Ublock Origin. So, step 1. I tried the popular blocklists. They acutally sucked.
So next, I tried some more blocklists, and some more. And, eventually this is what I found. It's not enough to replace ublock origin, but its good enough for most pickier people.
They are NextDNS Ads & Trackers Blocklist, notracking, and 1Hosts Pro.

Ok.
Bye, bozos.
